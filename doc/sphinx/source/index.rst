Welcome to the PyCpuSimulator documentation!

.. note:: The official Home Page of PyCpuSimulator is located at |PyCpuSimulatorUrl|

    If you are at http://readthedocs.org then you are reading the so called *latest documentation*.

    The *latest documentation* |PyCpuSimulator@readthedocs-badge| is automatically built from the
    git repository after each commit.

    As opposite the |PyCpuSimulatorHomePage|_ is built manually and is thus less prone to errors.
